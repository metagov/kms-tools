    "text": "<@U02TV7DPGBG> continuing discussion here from the govbase thread\n\nthe way RIDs work is fairly agnostic towards different file types, you can reference anything if you can come up with a way of representing it, regardless of how the actual data is stored or retrieved. In practice there are some considerations that have to be made, in the case of data like a video recording, it would need to be converted to a text format to be used in a lot of the subsystems within KOI. For example, the vector embedding system we use only works with text data, so we couldn't natively embed images, audio, video, etc. but could send them to a transcriber or have an AI describe what it sees in text to provide a version of the data compatible with parts of the system. However it's also perfectly fine to just have a video that is RIDed and can only be used in the most basic ways, where the system knows it exists and can link to it but can't do it anything more complex with it.",

The KOI in KOI Pond stands for Knowledge Organization Infrastructure, which the chat bot in <#C06LAQNLVNK|koi-tank> takes advantage of to give better answers based on Metagov knowledge, but this is just one possible integration to the infrastructure. Our current development is focused on building up the backend with graph based database infrastructure to support storing complex relationships between knowledge objects, users, and groups within Metagov. This will allows us to do things like weight the quality of knowledge sources utilized by the chat bot, automatically and manually observe new knowledge objects from all of the platforms Metagov is on, and scope access to different types of knowledge based on a user's relationship to the org. Once this initial transition is complete, we can begin adding more knowledge to the system.",

    "text": "Reflection from today's meeting: A LARP to see emergent behaviours in relation to KOI would be a fun and hopefully productive thing to do. I support this. I'm just not sure yet whether I'd be involved in designing the LARP or be part of it (as ethnographer inside the LARP, as I was at the Black Swan event - I need to think about this). Other, more formal/structured ways of assessing KOI's change, use and challenges should also be explored, but we'd need researchers to propose those. Maybe we - as the team meeting to work on it regularly - just need a process for inviting people to design research of and using KOI? The ethnographic research is more meta research that would look at the practices and outcomes that result from undertaking research of various kinds (for instance, if we proceed with creative/games-based approaches to examining KOI does this change how it's perceived and used as opposed to doing very structured processes). An ethnography of a research community is different to reporting on the results of the research (although that is an important component). So if I seem hesitant to design an experiment/testing, it's partly because I'd like to see what emerges from metagov rather than from my own research planning/design processes. We do need to provide people with the opportunity to get involved and propose stuff, so the website is super important. How we describe possible research participation needs to be in there.

    "text": "Reflection from today's meeting: <@U02TV7DPGBG> proposes/decides to make all Cent's posts ephemeral so they can't be ingested into the KOI, but <@UTER5GXFW> mentions that some BlockSci people started copying chats from personal DMs/channels into public channels as they wanted them to be included. Right now, Metagov has a lot of discussion about people's projects and myriad interesting thoughts on governance things happening out there in the world. I am curious to see if (and who) starts adding their longer-form written texts so that they are (kinda) creative commonsed to KOI's purview. (Side note - at the moment all of our seminars are publicly accessible but they are not repurposed for KOI's use so do we need some kind of agreement from people for that prior to them giving a seminar?) There are IP issues but it's exactly like creative commons in that the possible usefulness of what you do likely expands as it becomes accessible and picked up by KOI and then others. Particularly as KOI will tell people what sources it's drawing on. So you potentially get more exposure for your work/ideas by agreeing to contribute a knowledge object. And then this comes back to contribution goods (my area of research). Kealey and Ricketts wrote that theory specifically in relation to scientific societies. A contribution good differs from a club good in key ways, including that the membership can be open but the good becomes more valuable as more high quality contributors participate. Where am I going with this? Maybe KOI is about governing contribution goods. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",

    "text": "KOI stands for Knowledge Organization Infrastructure, and it also plays nicely into a <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carp|carp>-based branding scheme. [Maybe goes without saying, but I'm not much at marketing.] At BlockScience, KOI is the research bucket that includes the development of KMS, or Knowledge Management System. More specific to <#C06DMGNV7E0|koi-pond>, it's a play on BlockScience's Project Goldfish.\n\nProject Goldfish moves BSci-KMS from being a PoC with an uptime reliability of 0.2 9s on a good day to a system that is operationally significant. The name alludes to the common result of first forays into fish-as-pet ownership, namely goldfish in a small bowl in which the fish dies, followed by an effort to provision a more sophisticated aquarium to serve as a home in which the next goldfish can grow and prosper.\n\nKOI Pond is an extension of this narrative alluding to the desire to create an ecosystem for many koi to grow and prosper. If goldfish at BSci is 0 --> 1, and koi at Metagov is 1 --> 2, then the goal is to get to many.",
